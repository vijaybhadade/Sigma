    <!--Poem-->
    <p>I met a travel ler from an antique land ,<br/>
        Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br/>
        Stand in the desert....Near them , on the sand,<br/>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies , whose frown,<br/>
        And wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command,<br/>
        tell that its  sculptor well those passion read ,<br>
        which yet survive,stamped on these lifeless things, <br> 
        the hand that mocked them,and the heart that fed, <br>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear. <br>
        My name is <u> ozymandias</u>,king of kings. <br>
        look on my work,    ye mights and disconnect. <br>
    </p>
